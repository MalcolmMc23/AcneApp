1. Acne Severity & Future Clarity Score
   Goal: Quantify a user’s current acne severity and predict future improvements.
   AI Involvement: Take user inputs (photos, lifestyle factors), process them via a scoring model, then generate a projected “Clarity Score” for the coming days/weeks.
2. Progress Updates
   Goal: Provide periodic updates on the user’s skin condition (weekly or monthly).
   AI Involvement: Automatically prompt users for new data/photos, recalculate scores, highlight improvements or regressions, and generate a short summary or explanation.
3. Personalized AI Acne Coach (Chat)
   Goal: Offer interactive Q&A and customized advice.
   AI Involvement: A conversational model that references user data (skin type, past performance, allergies) to make context-aware suggestions (e.g., product recommendations, lifestyle tips).
4. Daily Routine & Habit Tracking
   Goal: Guide users through a day-to-day skincare and lifestyle regimen.
   AI Involvement: Generate a list of tasks (e.g., morning cleanser, diet tips), monitor compliance, and adapt future recommendations based on user behavior and results.
5. Community Forum & Social Features
   Goal: Allow users to share progress, ask questions, and get peer support.
   AI Involvement: Moderate forum content (e.g., detect spam or harmful advice), highlight high-value discussions, and possibly match similar users for mutual support.
6. Data Visualization & Insights
   Goal: Show how acne severity correlates with lifestyle (diet, sleep, etc.).
   AI Involvement: Parse user logs, run correlation analyses, and present insights (e.g., “Reduced sugar intake correlated with a 15% drop in severity”).
7. Notifications & Reminders
   Goal: Keep users on track with routines.
   AI Involvement: Schedule timely push notifications, adapt the frequency based on user engagement patterns, and personalize messages (e.g., “Don’t forget your moisturizer!”).
8. Onboarding & Personalization
   Goal: Gather initial data on user’s skin concerns and environment.
   AI Involvement: Use this data to initialize user profiles; tailor initial routines, product suggestions, and severity scoring thresholds.
9. Premium / Advanced Features (Optional)
   Goal: Provide more sophisticated capabilities (e.g., direct dermatologist Q&A).
   AI Involvement: Possibly integrate advanced computer vision for photo analysis, or more specialized AI modules for deeper product matching.
10. Photo-Based Skin Analysis (If Implemented)
    Goal: Automatically detect breakouts, inflammation, and other skin issues.
    AI Involvement: Use computer vision (CNNs or other ML models) to estimate acne severity from user-submitted photos, then store results to track progress over time.
