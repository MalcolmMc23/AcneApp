- Do’s
  Emphasize Clarity:
  Design with clear, legible text and visuals that let users easily understand and interact with your content.

  Practice Deference:
  Let your content take center stage—use subtle UI chrome and avoid overwhelming decorative elements.

  Maintain Consistency:
  Use standard system components, icons, and interactions so users feel at home with familiar patterns.

  Keep It Simple:
  Strive for a clean and minimalistic interface. Every element should serve a purpose and contribute to a straightforward user experience.

  Keep it modern and clean.

  Use Depth Thoughtfully:
  Apply layering, translucency, and realistic animations to provide context without distraction.

  Provide Immediate Feedback:
  Whether through subtle animations or tactile responses, ensure that interactions are acknowledged so users know their actions have been registered.

  Ensure Adaptability and Accessibility:
  Design interfaces that work well across devices and orientations, and follow accessibility guidelines so everyone can use your app.

- Don’ts
  Avoid Overcrowding:
  Don’t clutter the screen with unnecessary elements or overly complex visuals that can confuse users.

  Don’t Deviate from Platform Conventions:
  Avoid custom controls or gestures that break the established behaviors users expect on Apple devices.

  Steer Clear of Excessive Effects:
  Overusing animations or flashy graphics can distract from content and hurt performance.

  Don’t Hide Core Functionality:
  Important actions should be easily discoverable—don’t bury them behind non-obvious gestures or menus.

  Don’t Sacrifice Clarity for Creativity:
  While innovation is welcome, never compromise on legibility or intuitive navigation.
